This example contain the configuration files for the follwing setup:

	node 2: DIG node wuth local output toggle
	node 6: DTH node with loacal output toggle and temerature / humidity measurement
	node 4: RC node that controls a klikaanklikuit switch at address C1
	

The standard DIG and DTH nodes have been configured to:

- send an acknowledgement after every write commando from openhab. ACK has been set to TRUE.
- send a state message after each local toggle of the output.

In this way the node sends a status message after each output change, generated by openhab or by pushing the button on the node.
The rules file contains rules to inspect these messages, and update the Openhab status of the output accordingly.
In this way the openhab status is not set by Openhab, but by a feedback message received from the node. 
If somehow the command has not reached the node, (bad radiosignal) the status in openhab is not changed.

Most of the time a small delay can be observed between pressing the button in the Openhab UI and the state change in the UI.

ITEMS
In the items file a switch is configured to store the received status of the output. 
To display the status in the UI the following icons must be copied in folder /usr/share/openhab/webapps/images:

	light-on.png must be copied to lamp-open.png
	light-off.png must be copied to lamp-closed.png
	
RULES
In this file rules are included to:
	- read RSSI values once a minute
	- update output values for node2 and node 6
	- switch a light on and off via klikaanklikuit at preset times each day
